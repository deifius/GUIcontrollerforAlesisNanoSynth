State/program control and recall for Alesis Nano Quadra Synth


This is a compact program to inerface with the Alesis Nano Synth, which is a 1/3 rack unit release of the quadrasynth line of synthesizers.
The hardware interface is minimal (unusable) and so this program's primary purpose is to render all channels accessible and manageable.
Almost implemented is a preset store and recall feature.
